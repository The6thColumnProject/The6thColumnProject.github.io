We believe the path to getting there is by reducing the friction and needless toil we experience in the current state of computing.

We get there not necessarily from a UI/UX standpoint but from re-imaginig computing from first principles. We believe that computing is ripe for an evolutionary step change. With the advent of accessible and powerful AI, W3 and peer-to-peer networks and the distributed web, we have the necessary base for us to bring forth a new era.
