We believe the path to getting there is by reducing the friction and needless toil we experience in the current state of computing. We endeavor to create more seamless interaction between people and our computing environments. We get there not necessarily from a UI/UX standpoint but from re-imaginig computing from first principles. We focus on aggressive automation and hyper personalization. We believe that computing is ripe for an evolutionary step change. With the advent of utility computing, accessible and powerful AI, W3 and peer-to-peer networks and the decentralized web, we have the necessary base for us to bring forth a new era.
