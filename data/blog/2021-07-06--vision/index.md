The internet in the current state is not entirely what it was
conceived to be. We have some huge players on the web and that is a
product of market forces and the complexity of the internet itself.  I
was _that guy_ that had his own stack of 1U VA-Linux boxes in his
living room humming day and night, with a T1 line dropped to my house
in 1997. I ran my own class C IP address, DNS, SMTP mail server, web
server, music streaming server. I FTP'ed my files to my machines and
hosted my friends' "home pages".  I ran all the services.  I waited
until I pretty much *had to* succumb and get a gmail account because I
had moved across the country and wasn't able to take my digital world
with me. I was vexed because now I had to use a _service_ for
something that I can and had been doing myself.

In the first start up I was in, we did everything. I really mean everything!
We made the servers, we put the OS on them, we wrote our custom
software suite and then, we literally rolled them out to our
customers.  We set up networks, configured ISDN lines and had the hair
brained idea of hosting software at our location - off-site from our
clients so that they could outsource their IT and software. Hmmmm,
imagine that.

The truth is that capitalism came in and saw the opportunity to give
people "the internet" and wrap it up in an more palatable form factor.
I was fine with firing up emacs and reading terminals filled with
scrolling information, but that wasn't the case for the general,
larger population. Companies sprung up, wrapping services in
user friendly interfaces and allowing users to access
access through your browser. None of this is news, we know this
story. However, something exciting is happening...

Today, the general population is more savvy and familiar with the internet.
