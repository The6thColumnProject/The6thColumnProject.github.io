We believe the path to\n          getting there is by reducing the friction and needless toil\n          we experience in the current state of computing. We endeavor\n          to create more seamless interaction between people and our\n          computing environments. We get there not necessarily from a\n          UI/UX standpoint but from re-imaginig computing from first\n          principles. We believe that computing is ripe for an\n          evolutionary step change. With the advent of accessible and\n          powerful AI, W3 and peer-to-peer networks and the\n          distributed web, we have the necessary base for us to bring\n          forth a new era.  One where computing will do what we\n          imagined it would do and profoundly elevate the human\n          condition. Aggressive automation will reduce the pain from\n          incidental complexity. Hyper personalization makes our tools\n          our partners and fosters meaningful human social\n          collaboration.\n\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n\n          Our team has consistently solved big problems in various areas of computing at scale.\n          <ul>\n            <li><b>Financial sector:</b> Building trading and portfolio\n              management systems for Wall Street.
