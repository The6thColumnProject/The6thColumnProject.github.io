We have some huge players on the web and that is a\nproduct of market forces and the complexity of the internet itself.  I\nwas <em>that guy</em> that had his own stack of 1U VA-Linux boxes in his\nliving room humming day and night, with a T1 line dropped to my house\nin 1997. I ran my own class C IP address, DNS, SMTP mail server, web\nserver, music streaming server. I FTP'ed my files to my machines and\nhosted my friends' \"home pages\".  I ran all the services.  I waited\nuntil I pretty much <em>had to</em> succumb and get a gmail account because I\nhad moved across the country and wasn't able to take my digital world\nwith me. I was vexed because now I had to use a <em>service</em> for\nsomething that I can and had been doing myself.</p>\n<p>In the first start up I was in, we did everything. I really mean everything!\nWe made the servers, we put the OS on them, we wrote our custom\nsoftware suite and then, we literally rolled them out to our\ncustomers.  We set up networks, configured ISDN lines and had the hair\nbrained idea of hosting software at our location - off-site from our\nclients so that they could outsource their IT and software. Hmmmm,\nimagine that.</p>\n<p>The truth is that capitalism came in and saw the opportunity to give\npeople \"the internet\" and wrap it up in an more palatable form factor.\nI was fine with firing up emacs and reading terminals filled with\nscrolling information, but that wasn't the case for the general,\nlarger population. Companies sprung up, wrapping services in\nuser friendly interfaces and allowing users to access\naccess through your browser. None of this is news, we know this\nstory. However, something exciting is happening...</p>\n<p>Today, the general population is more savvy and familiar with the internet.</p>","excerpt":"The internet in the current state is not entirely what it was\nconceived to be.
